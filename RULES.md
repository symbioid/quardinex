Welcome to Quardinex! 
Your mission is to visit every square on the board.

#----------------------
[Turquoise Square] = You Are Here (Source)
[Orange Square] = You Can Go Here (Target)
[Numbers] = Move Amount
[PeachPuff3 Squares]  
#----------------------

You can move [Up, Down, Left, or Right].
The number of spaces you can move from your position is determined by the number on your [Turquoise Square].
When you click on an Orange Target Square, that becomes your new position.
The Orange target is changed to Turquoise.
The [Turquoise Square you just moved from is now removed from the board presenting a black hole,
where a Square used to be.
Keep going until you land on one final square.
You beat the level.

---------------------
Select the next level (you can enter any level at any time; there is no limit or "unlock" required)

Some boards may have more than one solution.
Upcoming Features

Popup "Reload" button when no more moves left.
Popup "Next Level" button after beating level.
Still working on the graph solver for this thing;
it's theoretically so easy, but...

Solve Graph - calculate how many solutions per level, divide by (m,n) (e.g. (rows, columns))
Gives base difficulty.
Expand with this knowledge:
- "Assistance with tips.  
- If you want a "Hard" assist, you can have the one with least possible exits from here." 
- If you want "Easy" assist, the one with most possible solutions.  

* Why does my brain want to call this shoaring? 
--------
Base difficulty converts to scaling and level "flow"/presentation.
I picture 3 base sizes (3-5) maybe unlock 6-9 or something.
